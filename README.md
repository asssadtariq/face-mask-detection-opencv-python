# face-mask-detection-opencv-python
In this project, I used image processing techniques to detect the face mask on a face.

There is no machine learning or deep learning technique has been used in this project, it detects the mask based on the values of colors.
Its results are limited because it is built only for few colors of masks.
This is for practice purpose
